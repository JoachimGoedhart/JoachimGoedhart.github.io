Welcome to my personal website. I am an assistant professor at the section of [Molecular Cytology](http://www.molcyto.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. My research focuses on the development and application of fluorescent probes for the study of molecular processes inside living cells with microscopy. In addition, I am working on ways to simplify data analysis and data visualization and to this end I have co-developed Shiny apps and dashboards. Our lab is committed to share our tools and expertise, so feel free to reach out if you have questions. </br> I am a teacher in several courses that deal with cell biology, (advanced) microscopy or data visualization at different levels (BsC, MsC, PhD and up).
