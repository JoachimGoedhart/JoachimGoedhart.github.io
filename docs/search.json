We deposit the most relevant (and popular) plasmids that are generated at the Section of Molecular Cytology at addgene. The benefit is that the plasmids are (generally) fully sequence verified. If you are interested in any of our plasmids, I encourage you to check the addgene website where the plasmids are organized by article:\n\n Find our Plasmids"

To simplify data visualization and to encourage the transparent presentation of data, we have generated a number of web apps. These online apps implement state-of-the-art data visualization methods in a user-friendly way and are open source and freely accessible. Several of the apps have been published and it is advised to read the accompanying papers to learn how the apps can be used (you can find this information under the ‘About’ tab of each web app). The example output of the apps should give you some idea of what kind of figures you can make:\n\nThe apps are open-source and freely accessible at https://huygens.science.uva.nl/, or alternatively through this site.\nThe code and scripts that we generate for our research and education are available at Github. Most of the code deals with data Visualization."

We have generated a couple of interactive dashboards, using either {shiny} or the {flexdashboard} package.\nThe polarVolcaNoseR app was developed in {shiny} in collaboration with Román González Prieto to share research data in an accessible way. You will find more information in the accompanying paper.\nAnother example is a dashboard that can be used to show how many plasmids have been shared with the community via addgene. This dashboard is made with the {flexdashboard} package. Users can upload their plasmid request data and visualize the stats on a dashboard that is available here.

It all started when I realized that transparency in data presentation (by showing the data) is crucial. This was - at that time - not common (and the number of tools to present data in a clear way was )partially because of a lack of good tools). To make my point that showing the data is important, I generated this animation of exploding barplots (you can make one with your own data with this script):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blogs that I have written are posted on different platforms and deal with statistics, data visualization and Fluorescent Protein technology.

To gather this information in a central and structured way, I have generated an online resource (or book, if you will) with DataViz protocols. This is a living document that will be updated whenever a new dataViz protocol is ready. If you have suggestions, please let me know! Here is a selection of the different data visualizations that are covered by a protocol:"
