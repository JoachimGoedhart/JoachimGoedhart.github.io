# Website | Quarto

My personal website hadn't been updated for years (Last update: August 2017). Instead of updating, I decided to build a new website from scratch. The previous site was manually coded in HTML/CSS. This is OK-ish for a small website like the one I had, but I wanted to explore new tools. Since I have some experience with R and Markdown, the Quarto framework seemed promising. And [here it is](https://joachimgoedhart.github.io/), a site generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).


Besides the official Quarto documentation, I took inspiration from other websites in Quarto (and, conveniently, the code that was available on Github). Some of the sites that I checked out:
